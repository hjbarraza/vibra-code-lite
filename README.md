Vibra is a Claude Code plugin from [Vibra](https://getvibra.co) that acts as the community manager hire for paid, invite-only, and professional WhatsApp communities. It reads a chat export and turns hours of weekly scrolling into the artifacts a CM actually needs: weekly digests, unanswered-question follow-up queues, retention dashboards, member profiles, newsletter content, and stakeholder reports.

Everything runs on your laptop. No external services. No API keys. Your community data never leaves your machine.

> **Want the full product?** This open-source plugin is the local-first entry point. For the hosted experience with longitudinal memory, team collaboration, and richer intelligence views — visit [**getvibra.co**](https://getvibra.co).

## Who this is for

You run a paid or invite-only WhatsApp community. Maybe 50 members, maybe 500. Every week you scroll the chat to figure out what happened, who asked something that never got answered, who's gone quiet, who to DM. You write a weekly digest. You prepare a monthly report for the owner.

This takes hours. Vibra takes it down to minutes.

## Install

You need three things: **Claude Code**, **Node**, and **Vibra**. Takes 5 minutes.

### 1. Install Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's developer tool. It comes in two forms — pick either, plugins work identically in both.

**Desktop app** (easier if you prefer a graphical interface):

- **macOS:** [download the DMG](https://claude.ai/api/desktop/darwin/universal/dmg/latest/redirect)
- **Windows:** [download the installer](https://claude.com/download)

Open the app, sign in with your Claude account (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise, or Console — the free claude.ai plan doesn't include Claude Code).

**Terminal CLI** (for developers / power users):

macOS or Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or via package manager:
- Homebrew: `brew install --cask claude-code`
- WinGet: `winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode`
- npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

After installing, run `claude` in a terminal and sign in.

### 2. Check Node 20+

Vibra's scripts run on Node.js 20 or newer. Check with `node --version`. If it prints `v20.x` or higher, skip ahead.

If Node is missing or older:

- **macOS:** `brew install node` (needs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh))
- **Windows:** download the installer from https://nodejs.org
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install nodejs npm` or `nvm install 20`

(If you installed Claude Code via npm, Node is already there.)

### 3. Install Vibra inside Claude Code

Open Claude Code (terminal `claude` command, or the desktop app — both work). Then run these commands in order:

```
/plugin marketplace add hjbarraza/vibra-plugin
/plugin install vibra@getvibra
/reload-plugins
```

The `/reload-plugins` step activates the newly-installed commands in your current session. If the `/vibra:*` commands still don't appear after reloading, **exit Claude Code (Ctrl+C twice, or `/exit`) and start a fresh session** — that guarantees the plugin loads cleanly.

Verify it worked:
```
/vibra:pulse
```

Should either show the usage hint (path required) or auto-complete. If instead you see "command not found," re-check the `/plugin` **Installed** tab (should list `vibra`) and the **Errors** tab (should be empty).

Update later:
```
/plugin marketplace update getvibra
/reload-plugins
```

---

**Alternative — clone + `--plugin-dir`** (for local development or if you want to inspect the code first; terminal CLI only):

```bash
cd ~/Code
git clone https://github.com/hjbarraza/vibra-plugin.git
claude --plugin-dir /absolute/path/to/vibra-plugin
```

Zero dependencies to compile. No `npm install` needed.

## Your first 5 minutes

### Step 1 — export a WhatsApp chat

**On iOS:**
1. Open the group chat
2. Tap the group name at the top
3. Scroll down → **Export Chat**
4. Choose **Without Media**
5. Save or AirDrop the `.zip` to your Mac

**On Android:**
1. Open the group chat
2. Tap ⋮ (three dots) → **More** → **Export chat**
3. Choose **Without media**
4. Save the `.txt`

If you got a `.zip`, unzip it. The file you actually need is `_chat.txt` (iOS) or `WhatsApp Chat with <name>.txt` (Android).

### Step 2 — open Claude Code with the plugin enabled

```bash
cd ~/your-working-folder       # where you want Vibra's output to land
claude --plugin-dir /absolute/path/to/vibra-plugin
```

First time: Claude Code will ask for two optional settings (where to save artifacts, preferred language). Accept the defaults.

### Step 3 — ask in plain language

In the Claude Code session:

> analyze my whatsapp export at ~/Downloads/_chat.txt

Claude picks the right skill and runs it. You'll see something like:

```
Community: Collective Tech
Window: 2026-04-15 → 2026-04-22
75 messages, 17 active members, 21 threads.
Roster: 17/86 active this window, 11 never posted.
Response rate: 86%.
Pulse dashboard: ./vibra-output/pulse-collective-tech-2026-04-22.html
```

Open the HTML in your browser. That's your community health snapshot.

Cmd+P (or Ctrl+P) → **Save as PDF** → you have a printable report with a "Powered by getvibra" footer.

---

## How to use each skill

You can call a skill directly with `/vibra:<name>` or just describe what you want.

### Weekly catch-up

```
/vibra:digest ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Produces a markdown summary — top threads, open asks, new members this week, members who went quiet. Windowed to the last 7 days of data by default; override with `--since YYYY-MM-DD --until YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Who's waiting for a reply

```
/vibra:unanswered ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Surfaces questions that didn't get a substantive answer. Not keyword matching — the agent reads the surrounding conversation and judges whether each question was actually addressed. Three sections: **unanswered**, **partially answered**, **fully answered**.

### Community dashboard (with PDF export)

```
/vibra:pulse ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Interactive HTML — activity curve by day, day-by-hour heatmap, top contributors, roster-vs-active ratio, response rate, concentration (Gini). Open in browser. Cmd+P for PDF.

### Your DM queue

```
/vibra:action-list ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Four sections in one markdown artifact:
- 🚨 **Frustration signals** — messages the AI flagged as real discontent
- 👻 **Long-silent members** — on the roster 30+ days, never posted
- 🎯 **Welcome gaps** — new joiners whose first message got ignored
- 🙌 **Shoutouts** — members who helped others this week

### Newsletter / content ideas

```
/vibra:content-ideas ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Top links by engagement, quotable member messages, tools and products mentioned. Fuel for your weekly newsletter or socials.

### One-page member profile

```
/vibra:profile ~/Downloads/_chat.txt --member "Josu San Martin"
```

Who are they? What do they care about? Who do they engage with most? Before a 1-on-1 or a sponsor intro, you get a narrative dossier.

Don't know the exact name? Run `/vibra:members` first to see the full roster, or just ask Claude to find the right member — it'll fuzzy-match.

### Monthly stakeholder report

```
/vibra:report ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

30-day default window. Growth vs prior period, health, top threads, contributors, what needs attention, what's next. Framed for the owner / founder / board, not the CM.

### Member list / roster audit

```
/vibra:members ~/Downloads/_chat.txt
```

Every member, ranked by messages. Find exact names for profile lookups. See who's never posted.

## Common questions

**Do my messages get sent anywhere?**
No. Vibra runs entirely on your laptop. The AI part happens inside your Claude Code session — that's already running on your machine. There are no external API calls from the plugin itself. No keys to manage, no data leaving your disk.

**Does it work on Windows / Linux / Mac?**
Yes, anywhere Claude Code and Node 20+ run.

**iOS or Android exports — both work?**
Yes. The parser auto-detects format.

**What about non-English communities?**
System messages and common patterns are recognized in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French out of the box. The AI-generated summaries always use your community's dominant language (auto-detected). You can force a language with `--lang es` (or `en`, `pt`, `fr`).

**What if my community has 10,000 members?**
Vibra's parser handles it. Processing is fast (seconds, not minutes). Artifacts scale gracefully — the dashboard caps at top 10 contributors, the digest caps at top 5 threads, the action list surfaces the highest-leverage items.

**Can I compare this week vs last week?**
Yes — run any command twice with different `--since` / `--until` windows and compare the outputs. Or ask Claude: _"digest for last week vs the week before"_.

**Do I have to retype the file path for every command?**
Not really. Claude reads the conversation — once you've pointed it at an export, subsequent questions use the same one. For slash-command usage (`/vibra:digest` with no args), set `VIBRA_EXPORT=/path/to/_chat.txt` in your shell and every command picks it up automatically.

**Where does the output go?**
`./vibra-output/` by default. You can change the default during plugin setup, or pass `--output-dir ~/Documents/my-community-artifacts` per command.

**How do I update Vibra?**

If you installed via marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace update getvibra
```

If you cloned the repo:
```bash
cd /path/to/vibra-plugin
git pull
```

**The `/vibra:*` commands don't appear after install.**
Run `/reload-plugins`. If that doesn't fix it, exit Claude Code and open a fresh session. If they're still missing, check `/plugin` → **Errors** tab for load failures, and try `claude --debug` to see what's happening at startup.

**I'm stuck.**

## Privacy

The only thing that touches a network is Claude Code itself (which you're already running). The plugin scripts are pure local code — parser, analyzers, renderers. Your WhatsApp export, every member name, every message — it all stays on your disk. Artifacts land in a folder you control.

We ship a permissive MIT license and don't track anything.

---

## What's next (the Pro tier)

Vibra v0.x is the **Normal tier**: stateless, runs every command fresh against the current export. Simple, portable, zero-config.

A **Pro tier** is planned that adds persistent storage — so re-exporting weekly doesn't re-process everything, so judgments are cached, so we can show longitudinal metrics ("this question has been unanswered for 3 weeks", "response rate declining over the last quarter"), and so local semantic embeddings unlock things like topic search and ask/offer matchmaking. Details in `docs/PRO_ROADMAP.md`.

---

## For developers

```bash
cd /path/to/vibra-plugin

# Run the test suite (44 tests, <100ms)
node --test "tests/*.test.js"

# Run any skill directly as a CLI
node bin/vibra-digest.js /path/to/export.txt --since 2026-04-01
```

Pull requests welcome. See `CLAUDE.md` for the tier-discipline rules we follow when adding features.
